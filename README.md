# 🌊 React Render Wave

**A compact React hook + component for effortlessly rendering large datasets in waves.**

React Render Wave helps you break rendering into small, timed batches to keep your UI smooth and responsive—especially when working with large lists or data-heavy UIs. By leveraging Rust for high-performance data processing and WebAssembly (WASM) for near-native speed in the browser, this solution ensures that rendering is both fast and memory-safe.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Lightweight and customizable

- 🌊 Progressive wave-based rendering (batchSize)

- 🧠 Virtual scroll with overscan support

- ⌨️ Keyboard navigation

- 🦴 Skeleton loading support

- 🧲 Snap-to-batch scroll alignment

- ⚛️ Built with modern React and TypeScript

- 🚀 Rust-powered data handling for ultra-fast performance and memory safety (via WebAssembly)

## 🚀 Performance Benefits of Rust

To ensure smooth UI rendering even when handling massive datasets, React Render Wave leverages Rust, compiled to WebAssembly (WASM). Rust's efficiency in managing memory and its ability to handle large data structures with high concurrency make it the perfect choice for accelerating data processing in the browser.

Key Benefits:
Blazing Fast Data Handling: Rust’s low-level control over memory and concurrency allows us to process data more efficiently, resulting in faster rendering times for large datasets.

Memory Safety: By using Rust, we avoid common bugs such as data races or memory leaks, ensuring a reliable user experience.

WebAssembly Integration: Rust is compiled into WebAssembly (WASM) for near-native performance directly in the browser, without requiring additional backend resources.

## 📦 Installation

```bash
npm install react-render-wave
# or
yarn add react-render-wave
```

## 🧪 Basic Usage

```jsx
import { RenderWave } from "react-render-wave";

const items = Array.from({ length: 1000 }, (_, i) => `Item ${i}`);

<RenderWave
  items={items}
  batchSize={20}
  interval={60}
  renderItem={(item, index) => <div key={index}>{item}</div>}
/>;
```

## 🔁 Virtual Scroll Usage

```jsx
import { VirtualRenderWave } from "react-render-wave";

<VirtualRenderWave
  items={items}
  itemHeight={40}
  containerHeight={400}
  overscan={5}
  keyboardNavigation
  renderItem={(item, index) => <div>{item}</div>}
/>;
```
